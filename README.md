# Currency Converter 💱

A simple **Currency Converter UI** built with **HTML and CSS** (no JavaScript yet).  
This project focuses on practicing frontend structure, layout, and styling — featuring a neumorphic design, smooth animations, and a responsive look.

## Overview

- Enter an amount to convert  
- Choose “From” and “To” currencies  
- View exchange rates visually  

It’s designed for learning and improving basic web styling techniques like gradients, shadows, and interactive hover effects.

## Features
- Clean **neumorphism-inspired** circular design  
- Smooth hover, fade, and pop-in animations  
- Uses **Font Awesome icons** for visuals  
- Flag icons for better UI representation
